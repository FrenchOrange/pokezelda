NOTES:
* Heabutt tree and Rock Smash 'mon now have more varied levels, and the encounter rates have been tweaked as to make Pineco, Aipom, and Shuckle more common.
* Geodude, Kingler, and Slugma have been added to the Rock Smash Pokémon encounter table.
* The Goldenrod Game Corner Prize Pokémon were changed to Abra (level 10 / 200 coins), Clefairy (level 12 / 800 coins), and Pikachu (level 12 / 1500 coins).
* The Celadon Game Corner Prize Pokémon were changed to Eevee (level 15 / 6666 coins), Larvitar (level 18 / 8888 coins), and Porygon (level 20 / 9999 coins).
* The Kanto legendary birds are no longer set to have a flee value. So don't worry about that.
